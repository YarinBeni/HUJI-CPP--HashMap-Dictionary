# C++ HashMap and Dictionary Project
This repository contains the code for a C++ project that implements a HashMap data structure and a Dictionary class that inherits from HashMap.  
The project was completed as part of the HUJI course 67315 (2022) PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP IN C & C++.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) and the C++ Standard Library.

## Project Description
In this project, we implemented the HashMap data structure using an open hashing method. The HashMap allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs, with a time complexity of O(1) for most operations.

We also created a Dictionary class which inherits from HashMap and stores keys and values as strings.  
The Dictionary class provides additional functionality for storing and retrieving string values.
